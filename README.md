# supply-run
A tiny phaser game about collecting work supplies.

## Plot:
A message from the Wizard:

    Congratulations on joining the team. Glad to have you with us.
    Your first mission is to help us get supplies by collecting coin.
    I'll send you to town to collect some.
    Just watch out for those pesky people. Not a friendly lot.
